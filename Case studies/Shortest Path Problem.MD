# Shortest Path Problem

#### This problem is about finding the shortest path in a graph.

## Weighted Edges

In this type of edges in a graph have some numeric values associated with them. The shortest path is where sum of the edges is small as possible.

##  UnWeighted Graph

In this type of graph the shortest path would just be the one with fewest number of edges. It is actually a breadth first search (BFS). With BFS you start
at one node and visits the closest node first, slowly moving out to distant nodes until you find the one you are looking for.
